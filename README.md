youtubeHiQ
==========

A Chrome extension based on Focus/youtubequality. This extension only matches youtube.com, not just any
youtube player. Attempts to select video stream with highest quality, and to resize the viewport to fit. 
At version 1.0, it should work with playlists, HTML5, and flash.

At first I just wanted to refactor the code but now it is different, definitely more automatic. Still 
not userfriendly. See change log for current state.
